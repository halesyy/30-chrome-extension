      If you can't be bothered reading something, dump it in here and listen whilst you multitask on another goal in your life.</textarea>

        If received well, I plan to allow the creation of a list of "readables" that can be clicked on from saved blobs of text, saving last
        listening locations for revision, book readings, sharing, and so-on whilst you work in the background. Please report any errors, I
        did some "interesting" coding to make this work..
